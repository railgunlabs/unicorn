.SH NAME
uni_casefoldcmp \- case-insensitive string comparison
.SH LIBRARY
Embeddable Unicode Algorithms (libunicorn, -lunicorn)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unicorn.h>
.PP
.BI "unistat uni_casefoldcmp(unicasefold " casing ", const void *" s1 ", unisize " s1_len ", uniattr " s1_attr ", const void *" s2 ", unisize " s2_len ", uniattr " s2_attr ", bool *" result ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Check if \f[I]s1\f[R] and \f[I]s2\f[R] are a caseless match in casing form \f[I]casing\f[R].
If they match, then the implementation writes \f[C]true\f[R] to \f[I]result\f[R] else it writes \f[C]false\f[R].
.PP
The length and text attributes for \f[I]s1\f[R] are specified by \f[I]s1_len\f[R] and \f[I]s1_attr\f[R].
The length and text attributes for \f[I]s2\f[R] are specified by \f[I]s2_len\f[R] and \f[I]s2_attr\f[R].
If \f[I]s1_len\f[R] is \f[C]-1\f[R], then the implementation assumes \f[I]s1\f[R] is null terminated.
If \f[I]s2_len\f[R] is \f[C]-1\f[R], then the implementation assumes \f[I]s2\f[R] is null terminated.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
UNI_OK
If \f[C]text\f[R] was checked successfully.
.TP
UNI_BAD_OPERATION
If \f[I]s1\f[R] or \f[I]s2\f[R] are \f[C]NULL\f[R], or if \f[I]result\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R].
.TP
UNI_BAD_ENCODING
If \f[I]s1\f[R] or \f[I]s2\f[R] is not well-formed (checks are omitted if the corresponding \f[B]uniattr\f[R](3) has \f[B]UNI_TRUST\f[R](3)).
.TP
UNI_FEATURE_DISABLED
If the library was built without support for case folding.
.TP
UNI_NO_MEMORY
If dynamic memory allocation failed.
