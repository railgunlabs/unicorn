.SH NAME
uni_compress \- compress text
.SH LIBRARY
Embeddable Unicode Algorithms (libunicorn, -lunicorn)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unicorn.h>
.PP
.BI "unistat uni_compress(const void *" text ", unisize " text_len ", uniattr " text_attr ", uint8_t *" buffer ", size_t *" buffer_length ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Compress \f[I]text\f[R] using Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode (BOCU-1) and write the results to \f[I]buffer\f[R].
Text is compressed based on its code points, i.e. UTF-8, 16, and 32 will compress to the same byte sequence.
.PP
The capacity of \f[I]buffer\f[R] is specified by \f[I]buffer_length\f[R].
The implementation always writes to \f[I]buffer_length\f[R] the total number of bytes in the fully compressed text.
If the capacity of \f[I]buffer\f[R] is insufficient, then \f[B]UNI_NO_SPACE\f[R] is returned otherwise it returns \f[B]UNI_OK\f[R].
If \f[I]buffer\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R], then \f[I]buffer_length\f[R] must be zero.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
UNI_OK
On success.
.TP
UNI_NO_SPACE
If \f[I]buffer\f[R] is not large enough.
.TP
UNI_BAD_OPERATION
If \f[I]text\f[R] or \f[I]buffer_length\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R].
.TP
UNI_BAD_ENCODING
If \f[I]text\f[R] is not well-formed (checks are omitted if \f[I]text_attr\f[R] has \f[B]UNI_TRUST\f[R](3)).
.TP
UNI_FEATURE_DISABLED
If Unicorn was configured without support for the compression algorithm.
