.SH DESCRIPTION
Most functions in the Unicorn library return an element of this enumeration.
Of the elements, only \f[B]UNI_OK\f[R] and \f[B]UNI_DONE\f[R] represent a success status whereas the others represent failures.
.SH CONSTANTS
.TP
.BR UNI_OK
Represents the successful execution of an operation.
.TP
.BR UNI_DONE
Represents the successful completion of an operation.
An example of a function that returns this status code is \f[B]uni_next\f[R](3) which returns it when the end of the input string has been reached.
.TP
.BR UNI_NO_MEMORY
Functions that can dynamically allocate memory will list this constant as one of their potential return values.
Functions that omit this constant as a return value do not perform dynamic memory allocation.
.TP
.BR UNI_NO_SPACE
This failure code indicates the destination buffer is too small to receive the content and therefore a larger buffer must be used.
.TP
.BR UNI_BAD_ENCODING
This failure code indicates a malformed character sequence was encountered when decoding text.
Examples of malformed character sequences would be overlong sequences in UTF-8 or unpaired surrogate characters in UTF-16.
.TP
.BR UNI_BAD_OPERATION
This failure code is returned by functions when they are called with invalid arguments.
For example, a function might return this code when given a null pointer when a non-null pointer was expected.
.TP
.BR UNI_FEATURE_DISABLED
This failure code indicates the requested operation cannot be performed because the feature is disabled.
Unicorn allows consumers to customize the Unicode features itâ€™s built with.
This is useful for reducing the footprint of the library.
If a user attempts to call a function that uses a disabled feature of the library, then this status code will be returned.
.TP
.BR UNI_MALFUNCTION
This failure code indicates a defect with the implementation.
In a working version of Unicorn, an application will never see this status code.
If an application does encounter this code, it means there is a bug in Unicorn.
