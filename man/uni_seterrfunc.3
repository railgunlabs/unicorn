.SH DESCRIPTION
Associate the function \f[I]callback\f[R] with the library's internal error logger.
Anytime a function returns an error \f[I]callback\f[R] will be invoked with a description of the error.
It is up to the implementation of \f[I]callback\f[R] to be thread safe.
.PP
The implementation generally invokes \f[I]callback\f[R] at the moment the error occurs.
Callers are encouraged to set breakpoints in their implementation of \f[I]callback\f[R] and view the stack trace to discover the exact cause of the error.
